                    Hello everyone! 🌿 Why aren't we diving straight into those chaotic, fast <span class="creative-highlight">DEXs</span>? Because I, as you know, love to take everything <span class="creative-highlight">slow</span>!
                    <br>Our strategy is very simple: First, we will comfortably settle on the most comfortable branch of our <a href="https://t.me/blum/" target="_blank" class="highlight">Blum</a> tree. We are not gathering speedy day-traders, but loyal friends who, just like me, love to settle in for a long, peaceful <span class="creative-highlight">HODL</span> nap. Remember: <span class="creative-highlight">A Sloth in a hurry only stumbles on the road!</span> Come, let's grow slowly, steadily, and solidly, together.
                </p>
                
                <h3>🎯 OUR FIRST GOAL: A LONG WINTER SLEEP (<span class="highlight">1,500 TON</span>)</h3>
                <p>
                    Let's get a little lazier. When our liquidity pool reaches the sweet weight of exactly <span class="highlight">1,500 TON</span>... *That's* when we can slowly start swaying towards the <a href="https://app.ston.fi/swap" target="_blank" class="highlight"><b>Ston.fi</b></a> tree. We wait until we're ready for the crowds.
                    <br>Our ultimate goal is simple: to <span class="creative-highlight">take our place</span> as the most respected, most patient, and highest-mcap meme figure in the entire TON Ecosystem.
                </p>

        <div class="buy-steps">
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>🌳 BUILD YOUR TREE HOUSE (CREATE A WALLET)</strong>
                    <p>Don't get too excited... Take a deep breath first. Gently download the <a href="https://tonkeeper.com/" target="_blank" class="highlight"><b>Tonkeeper</b></a> wallet app or extension. Take your time to complete the setup for your wallet. Because this wallet is your most peaceful place to have your precious <span class="creative-highlight">$SLT HODL</span> nap.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>🍃 GATHER YOUR SLOTH FUEL (GET TON)</strong>
                    <p>For the few seconds you are awake... Make sure you have some <b>TON</b> in your wallet to swap for $SLT. If you don't have any TON yet, don't worry. You can buy it directly from exchanges like <a href="https://www.bybit.com/" target="_blank" class="highlight">Bybit</a> or <a href="https://www.okx.com/" target="_blank" class="highlight">OKX</a>, or gently transfer it from another wallet/exchange to your Tonkeeper nest. There is no rush.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>🌄 FIND YOUR PEACEFUL SPOT ON STON.FI</strong>
                    <p>Now... Open Google Chrome and <span class="creative-highlight">slowly</span> navigate to <a href="https://app.ston.fi/swap" target="_blank" class="highlight">Ston.fi</a>. <span class="creative-highlight">Connect</span> your Tonkeeper wallet to the platform. Then, <span class="creative-highlight">lightly</span> paste the correct $SLT Contract Address (the one you copied from our site) into Ston.fi, select $SLT, and confirm the transaction. When your Tonkeeper wallet asks you to sign the transaction, <span class="creative-highlight">sign it</span> and maintain your calm. <span style="font-size: 14px; opacity: 0.6;">(A Little Sloth Note: Checking the contract address's accuracy <span class="creative-highlight">twice</span> is essential for a long and peaceful HODL sleep.)</span></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>💚 SWAP TON FOR $SLT</strong>
                    <p>Here is the most relaxing part: <span class="creative-highlight">Patiently</span> swap your TON for $SLT. We love living slow, but our transactions are strangely <span class="creative-highlight">FAST!</span> We love $SLT and TON very much, and since you completed this transaction, you are now one of the <span class="creative-highlight">most patient</span> members of the Sloth HODL family.</p>

                    <p>Oh, social media? Too noisy... Too fast... All those notifications, all that rushing... Not for us. The deepest secret of crypto is <span class="creative-highlight">anonymity</span>.

Our energy is focused on building a stable <span class="creative-highlight">community</span>, not stressing over keyboard wars. Look, we are slowly opening up! Our official <span class="creative-highlight">X (Twitter)</span> page is now active, providing a gentle hum of information. Our cozy <span class="creative-highlight">Telegram</span> community will follow gently later, when we're ready for more noise. Our slow and quiet progression is <span class="creative-highlight">NOT</span> a lack of effort; it's our maximalist marketing strategy. For us, <span class="creative-highlight">sincerity and organic growth</span> are far more valuable than temporary noise. On the contrary, we seek <span class="creative-highlight">maximalist comfort</span> and serenity.</p>
